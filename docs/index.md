# buildkit Provider

To use this provider you need to have a buildkit daemon running somewhere that is accessible
by the machine executing Terraform. An easy way to get started is to launch the buildkit daemon as
a container using a command like this:

```bash
docker run -d --name buildkitd --privileged -p 1234:1234 moby/buildkit:latest --addr tcp://0.0.0.0:1234 --debug
```

Now you just need to tell the provider about the daemon and configure any credentials necessary to authenticate
to the registries where you may want to publish the images you build.

```hcl

provider buildkit {
    buildkit_url = "tcp://127.0.0.1:1234"
    registry_auth {
        registry_url = "https://docker.io"
        username = "rutledgepaulv"
        password = "nicetry"
    }
}

```
